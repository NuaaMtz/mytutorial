good morning,professor.Shall we satrte?

I donâ€™t have much to share on my research progress this week. I've been discussing with He some things I missed in my work. For example, when simulating the 1535 event, I didn't consider the ratio of the two decay channels, which is quite important. This is easy to see in my code.This may be a reason for the bad robustness while calculate yeild.



Any suggestions or feedback would be great.
